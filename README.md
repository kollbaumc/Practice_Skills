# Practice_Skills

## This a repository where I have taken some of the basic skills I have learned and performed simple practice activities as reminders and to keep my skills sharp.

### 1.  The grade file is simple code written in notepad and saved as a .py file (allows client to enter their grade and decides whether the grade is a passing or failing grade) that can be run in miniconda.  

### 2. Webscraping_practice is an example of scraping data off a website (all-time Big Ten football wins) and organizing the data in a dataframe using pandas.
