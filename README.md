# Practice_Skills

## This a repository where I have taken some of the basic skills I have learned and performed simple practice activities as reminders and to keep my skills sharp.

### 1.  The grade file is simple code written in notepad and saved as a .py file (allows client to enter their grade and decides whether the grade is a passing or failing grade) that can be run in miniconda.  

### 2. Webscraping_practice is an example of scraping data off a website (all-time Big Ten football wins) and organizing the data in a dataframe using pandas.

### 3. Processing_datapractice is an example where I took data from a housing prices list and worked on things like filling in missing values, narrowing down the data according to state or county, checking data types of the attributes, and other skills.  

### 4. Sentiment_practice is a file where I took a sentence and wrote code using a spacy pipeline and spacytextblob to measure the polarity and subjectivity of the words in the sentence.
